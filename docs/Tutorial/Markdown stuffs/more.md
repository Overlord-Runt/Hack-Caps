# Changing the shape of the cap

To change the shape of the keycap, you can go into **Fusion's timeline**, a bar on the bottom of the screen containing command icons like Extrude or Fillet that shows the history of your model. From here, you can change many things about the keycap! <br/>
* Do you want a differently sized base? Maybe you want chamfers? Go into the first sketch and change the shape and update the loft (or any features that break/need to be updated)!
* Do you want a taller/shorter keycap? Go into the **Offset Plane** and adjust the height! make it 1,000,000 millimeters tall i dont care
* Do you want a differently shaped top? Go into the second sketch set on the offset plane and change it!

Additionally, if you already have a shape in mind, you can **preemptively** design the shape while making the keycap, leading to less errors and more control over the design, which is what I did when making my custom octogon-like keycaps for the Engiboard! <br/>

*You can do anything with custom keycaps!* <br/>

* Do you want a ***whole ass cooking wok*** on your keycap? Model a wok separately, import it into the design, position it, and combine the two bodies together! <br/>

* Do you want a typewriter-styled keycap with an A on it? Make a circular base, offset the 2nd profile by 6mm, make another circle, loft it, then add your text in with a border with a fillet on the inside edge! <br/>
