# Custom Keycaps
### Ever wanted to spice up your keyboard/Hackpad/fidget toy/where ever you have a keyboard switch?
Try making your own custom keycaps! <br/>
This short guide will go over my process of making **custom keycaps** for my Highway projects (as well as going over some handy CAD commands)
> encoder knob tutorial also included at the end :3 <br/>

> guide by @egg_splats! check out my other keyboard-related projects, [the Biblically Accurate Keyboard](https://github.com/hunkegg/biblicallyaccuratekeyboard) and [the Engipad](https://github.com/hunkegg/engipad) <br/>
> 
> FYI, this guide will be using Fusion 360! this guide will also be modeling keycaps for standard MX switches (no low-profile switches, but feel free to take notes/inspiration!)

## ...but why?
Custom keycaps are a nice way to add some personal flair and ***✩ polish ✩*** to your keyboard projects aside from the case and PCB. They can be placed anywhere, such as the escape key on a 75% keyboard or on a macro-binded key on a deskside macropad. <br/>
Custom keycaps can also help with making a **certain theme** more cohesive and "complete", such as the custom keycaps with eyes on my biblically accurate keyboard!
