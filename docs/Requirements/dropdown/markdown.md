# Journals

You must journal your time **AS YOU MAKE YOUR CAPS.** 

You cannot retroactively journal these.

## What do I need for the journal to count?

You need to have minimum 2 pictures of each cap. One of the design that you are going to put, and another of the end final product. You are free to add more pictures of the design process as you feel is necessary. Put text under each picture that explains each one.

DO NOT WRITE UP SOME AI BS ABOUT 'THE OPTIMAL STYLE' OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF AI BS.

:::tip[INSTEAD]

Talk about how you like it, how you like the goofiness of it, or how it goes well with your desk setup

## How do I structure my journal?

Your journal should be called `JOURNAL.md` and every entry should include the date as a title. You can then make your journal entry for the day. Include images that document what you did and text explaining you thought process, what you did, a fun joke, anything!
